#### How Are Survey Results Used?

The surveys help the Puget Sound Regional Council and communities
throughout the region plan transportation improvements. For example,
what role can transit, biking and walking play in improving regional
mobility? Having a complete picture of travel patterns helps produce
better plans for the future.

#### About the Survey Program

The 2017 and 2019 household travel surveys are part of a six-year survey program
for three waves (two-year survey cycles). This effort builds upon the
2014 and 2006 household travel surveys to continue to support a wide
variety of agency and member data and analysis needs. The 2019 survey
was completed in June 2019, and the final wave is planned for 2021,
depending on funding.
